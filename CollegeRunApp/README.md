First Iteration Report
=========================================================================================================================================
Summary:
This iteration saw the implementation of most of the basic functionality of our app including a game loop, user interface and menus, as     well as classes to represent the character and the various things he will encounter during gameplay. Support from the art team has been     sparse, therefore while we have employed assets, they are placeholders which will hopefully be replaced come time for the next iteration. For our next iteration, we hope to improve gameplay function by implementing the character's caffeine meter, platforms, powerups, an end to the level, as well as the obstacles which have already been outlined as classes. Testing was our weakness, and while this iteration does have functional tests, the coverage is limited.

Harrison's Report:
In this iteration I primarily worked on the core game and developed most of the components. Which included the following classes GameState, States, GameStateManager, CollegeRunApp, Person, Obstacle, AnimateRunner. I alos developed the test for Person and the test for obstacles. Along with developing the application I assisted my teammates by helping them through any problems they ran into during the iteration.

Ethan's Report:
In this iteration my contributions took the form of the app's MainActivity, which serves to redirect the user to the various menus and gamemodes that our app has to offer. In addition, I designed the abstract class PowerUp, which defined the basic parameters that all powerups in our game will adhere to, and is subclassed for three different sizes of coffee which will fill the player's caffeine meter by varying amounts. I also contributed to testing in the form of TestPowerUp and MainActivityTest.

Aidan's Report:
In this iteration I contributed primarily to LevelSelect.java and the corresponding layout activity_level_select.xml as specified in the user story for "Single Player Options/Single Player Settings/Level Select" (this user story was referred to by many names through the iteration). Level Select provides an interface for the user to launch their desired single player level. Class LevelSelect.java facilitates locking/unlocking of certain levels and launching those levels if unlocked through various methods. Additionally, I contributed to the test class for the aforementioned user story, LevelSelectTest.java. Our team ran into several issues implementing tests throughout this iteration, and while some tests remain non-functional, we plan to improve on them in future iterations.

Tom's Report:
In this iteration, my part was Setting-screen User Story. When the Setting button is clicked, the user is able to change the "Volume"
"Volume-seekbar" and the Music "Music-seekbar" for the game. Aside from that, I was not able to help with the Junit or Espresso Test.
I did not understand or how to get it to work and my teammates were helping me with tutorial videos and I'm working on it to understand
to help the team with next Iteration.
